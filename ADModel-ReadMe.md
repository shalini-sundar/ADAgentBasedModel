# AlzheimersModelNetlogo
Agent Based Modeling Framework for investigating the role of C. pneumoniae in late onset Alzheimer's disease

This model demonstrates one possible pathway of infection propagation of C. pneumoniae to regions of the brain.
The pathway considered maps the microbes moving through the olfactory tract and into the olfactory cortex and hippocampus.
We demonstrate how beta-amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangles may be formed and deposited based on prior art literature.
The model was developed using NetLogo and provides a spatial and temporal view of the system mechanism studied.

To use:
1) Adjust the variables via the sliders given (recommended values based on prior art and simulation testing provided to guidance)
2) Turn on the C. pneumoniae flux with the C-Pneumoniae-Exposure slider and keep one for how long needed.
3) Click Setup to populate the view with randomized agents.
4) Click Go to run the simulation and click Go again to pause or stop the run.
5) Plots of information provided on the left hand side of the model interface.
